# GDLversusDL

Comparison between Geometric Deep Learning and Deep Learning 

EXAMPLE: euclidean versus non euclidean deep learning, a Signal theory case
euclidean versus non euclidean deep learning: a financial trading case
Something like that

Word2Vec overview (for Euclidian text analysis)

Very good example of word embedding and NN for text anaysis. Using Stack overflow dataset (60000 user's questions): https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-word-embeddings-8a23817ab60f

Another suggestion for the text to be used as Dataset (this is only an articole, so it's much smaller): BitCoin White Paper by Satomi Nakamoto. Find it here: https://whitepaper.io/document/0/bitcoin-whitepaper
